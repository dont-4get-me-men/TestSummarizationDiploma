<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">(1) Select a set of can&amp;date words, (2) For each candldate word, find an appropriate chain relying on a relatedness cute.on among members of the chains, (3) If It is found, insert the word m the chain and update It accorchngly</mark> ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDIUFPDI?page=3&annotation=KHCCEKA9))

 
<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">The results on our data set indicate that only the following parameters are good predictors of the strength of a chmn Length: The number of occurrences of members of the chain Homogeneity index: 1 - the number of distract occurrences divided by the length We demgned a score function for chains as Score(Chain) = Length â€¢ Homogene=ty</mark> ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDIUFPDI?page=6&annotation=3M7RN33W))

<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Heuristic 2 We therefore defined a second heuristic based on the notion of representative words For each chain m the summary representation, choose the sentence that contains the first appearance of a representative chain member m the text In this special case this heuristic gives the same result as the first one Heuristic 3 Often, the same topic is dmcussed in a number of places in the text, so its chain is dL~tnbuted across the whole text Still, m some text unit, this global topic is the central topic (focus) of the segment We try to identify this umt and extract sentences related to the topic from this segment (or successive segments) only</mark> ([7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HDIUFPDI?page=7&annotation=HHAKNK7D))
