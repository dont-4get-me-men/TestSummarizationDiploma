> SELECTION OF PREFERRED METHOD. The percent of the number of sentences coselected in both the automatic and the target extracts was computed for each of the extracting methods, separately and in combination. The mean percentages for the most interesting methods are shown in Figure 4, with the intervals encompassing the sample mean plus and minus one sample standard deviation. The corresponding percentages for the random extracts (Le. arandom selection of 25 percent of the sentences) and the automatic extracts are given for comparison. The CueTitle-Location method isseen to have the highest mean coselectionscore, while the Key method in isolation is the lowest of the automatic methods. On the basis of these data it was decided to omit the Key met

> Combined Methods. The four basic methods described above yield 15 combined methods that have in common the following sequence of steps: 1. Select desired values for parameters at ,a2 , aa , a4 , and P. 2. Compute total weight atC + a2K + aaT + a4L of each sentence by summing its weighted single-method weights C, K, T, L. 3. Rank all sentences in decreasing weight order. 4. Select sentences whose rank order isless than length parameter P. 5. Select all headings. 6. Merge selected sentences under their proper headings. 7. Output title, authors, and results of step 6.
