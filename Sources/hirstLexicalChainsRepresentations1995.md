### Notes

<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Halliday and Hasan (1976) suggested that the words of the text that make such references can be thought of as forming cohesive chains in the text. Each word in the chain is related to its predecessors by a particular cohesive relation such as identity of reference. For example, in (1), the italicized words form a chain with this relation</mark> ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VX3AGVS3?page=3&annotation=XXXD9AEX))

 
<mark class="customZot-Blue ">Two words could be considered to be related if they are ‘connected’ in the thesaurus in one (or more) of five possible ways: 1. Their index entries point to the same thesaurus category, or point to adjacent categories. 2. The index entry of one contains the other. 3. The index entry of one points to a thesaurus category that contains the other. 4. The index entry of one points to a thesaurus category that in turn contains a pointer to a category pointed to by the index entry of the other.</mark> ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VX3AGVS3?page=4&annotation=E5HWWU9T))

 
<mark class="customZot-Blue ">5. The index entries of each point to thesaurus categories that in turn contain a pointer to the same category.</mark> ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VX3AGVS3?page=5&annotation=77XZPDXN))

 
<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Because a word may have more than one synset, when a new word record is constructed, a list of pointers to every synset of the word is created and attached to it. When a word starts a new chain, all its synsets are kept, since, at this point, no contextual information is available to discriminate among them (see Figure 5). Inserting another word into the chain results in a connection between the words by linking the synsets involved in the relation. When a word is inserted into a chain because</mark> ([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VX3AGVS3?page=9&annotation=T8JPWX8R))

 
<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">an extra-strong relation, all corresponding synsets are connected (see Figure 6). When the relation involved is strong, all pairs of strongly related synsets are connected (see Figure 7). And when the relation involved is medium-strong, the pair (or pairs) of synsets whose weight is of the greatest (or equal greatest) weight are connected. After the connection between words is made, any unconnected synsets of the new word are deleted and the chain is scanned to remove other synsets wherever possible. Synsets that are not involved in the current word connection are removed. Removing synsets while inserting words in a chain progressively disambiguates each word of the chain by removing uninvolved interpretations, thereby narrowing down the context. This idea comes from Hirst’s Polaroid Words (1987). Figure 8 illustrates the word-sense disambiguation process resulting from the situation illustrated in Figure 7.</mark> ([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VX3AGVS3?page=11&annotation=IDX3XIKH))
