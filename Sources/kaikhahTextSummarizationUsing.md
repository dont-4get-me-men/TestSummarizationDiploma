### Notes

<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Since the neural network is trained using a penalty function in phase I, the connections having very small weights after training can be pruned without affecting the performance of the network. As a result, any input or hidden layer neuron having no emanating connections can be safely removed from the network. In addition, any hidden layer neuron having no abutting connections can be removed. This corresponds to eliminating uncommon features from the network.</mark> ([3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/96ES4M8V?page=3&annotation=2LJS76U3))

<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">Our text summarization method performed well on the test paragraphs with accuracy of 96%. The selection of features as well as the selection of summary sentences by the human reader from the training paragraphs plays an important role in the performance of the network.</mark> ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/96ES4M8V?page=4&annotation=QE65B6DB))

 
<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">he network is trained according to the style of the human reader and to which sentences the human reader deems to be important in a paragraph. This, in fact, is an advantage our approach provides. Individual readers can train the neural network according to their own style. In addition, the selected features can be modified to reflect the readerâ€™s needs and requirement.</mark> ([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/96ES4M8V?page=4&annotation=NEUT92KD))
